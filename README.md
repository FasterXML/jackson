## Active Jackson projects by Project team

### Core modules:

Core modules are the foundation on which extensions (modules) build upon.
These are three and they are known as:

* [Streaming](../../jackson-core) ("jackson-core") defines low-level streaming API, and includes JSON-specific implementations
* [Annotations](../../jackson-annotations) ("jackson-annotations") contains standard Jackson annotations
* [Databind](../../jackson-databind) ("jackson-databind") implements data-binding (and object serialization) support on `streaming` package; it depends both on `streaming` and `annotations` packages

### Older resources

These are obsolete resources, mostly useful for historical interest:
