## Jackson Release 1.0

This was the first official non-beta release of Jackson.
Given that the first public pre-1.0 version was released in August 2007, development took over year and a half. 

Overview of release is:

* Release date: May 9th, 2009.
* Codename: "Hazelnut" (curious historical fact: lots of people choke on nuts -- this has something to do with choosing the codename)
* Functionality:
    * High-performance [Streaming (incremental) parser/generator]
    * [Tree Model]
    * Fully functional [Data Binding] between Java objects and JSON.
        * Including basic set of annotations for configuring details like JSON property names.
