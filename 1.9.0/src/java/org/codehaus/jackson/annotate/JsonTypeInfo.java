/**
 * Annotation used for configuring details of if and how type information is
 * used with JSON serialization and deserialization, to preserve information
 * about actual class of Object instances. This is necessarily for polymorphic
 * types, and may also be needed to link abstract declared types and matching
 * concrete implementation.
 *<p>
 * Some examples of typical annotations:
 *<pre>
 *  // Include Java class name ("com.myempl.ImplClass") as JSON property "class"
 *  &#064;JsonTypeInfo(use=Id.CLASS, include=As.PROPERTY, property="class")
 *  
 *  // Include logical type name (defined in impl classes) as wrapper; 2 annotations
 *  &#064;JsonTypeInfo(use=Id.NAME, include=As.WRAPPER_OBJECT)
 *  &#064;JsonSubTypes({com.myemp.Impl1.class, com.myempl.Impl2.class})
 *</pre>
 * Alternatively you can also define fully customized type handling by using
 * {@link org.codehaus.jackson.map.annotate.JsonTypeResolver} annotation.
 *<p>
 * NOTE: originally this annotation was only available to use with types (classes),
 * but starting with 1.7, it is also allowed for properties (fields, methods,
 * constructor parameters).
 *<p>
 * When used for properties (fields, methods), there annotation always defines
 * to <b>values</b>: specifically, when applied to a <code>Collection</code> or
 * <code>Map</code> property, it will <b>not</b> apply to container type but
 * to contained values. This is identical to how JAXB handles type information
 * annotations; and is chosen since it is the dominant use case. There is no
 * per-property way to force type information to be included for type of
 * container itself.
 * 
 * @see org.codehaus.jackson.map.annotate.JsonTypeResolver
 * 
 * @since 1.5 (but available to fields, methods and constructor params since 1.7)
