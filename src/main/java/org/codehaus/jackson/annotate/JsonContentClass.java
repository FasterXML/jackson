 * (phew! that's a mouthful!).
 * This is usually done if the declared element type is abstract or
 * too generic; annotation can denote actual concrete type to
 * instantiate when deserializing contents of the container.
 * To define type of the actual container itself, use 
 * {@link JsonClass} instead.
 *<p>
 * Note that the indicated type must be compatible with the declared
 * type; that is, it has to be a sub-type or implementation of
 * the declared type. This is usually the case; and if it wasn't
 * then the call to associated "setter" method would fail with
 * a type-mismatch exception.
