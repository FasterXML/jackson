 * There is a special marker Class ({@link NoClass}) that can be used to
 * indicate that no explicit deserializer is to be used -- such a 
 * work-around is needed because 'null' can not be used with

 * is that class used does indeed implement
 * {@link org.codehaus.jackson.map.JsonDeserializer}; but not whether
 * it declares that it can handle type given.
 *<p>
 * Note also that this method does NOT imply that the associated
 * method (when applied to one) is implicitly a setter:
 * rather, it must be recognized as one either due to its naming,
 * or by associated {@link JsonSetter} annotation.
