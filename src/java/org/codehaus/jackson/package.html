<body>
This package contains main public API of the core streaming JSON
processor: most importantly {@link org.codehaus.jackson.JsonFactory}
used for constructing
Json parser ({@link org.codehaus.jackson.JsonParser})
and generator
({@link org.codehaus.jackson.JsonParser})
instances.
<p>
Public API of the higher-level mapping interfaces ("Mapping API")
is found from
under {@link org.codehaus.jackson.map} and not included here,
except for following base interfaces:
<ul>
 <li>{@link org.codehaus.jackson.JsonNode} is included
within Streaming API to support integration of the Tree Model
(which is based on <code>JsonNode</code>) with the basic
parsers and generators (iff using mapping-supporting factory: which
is part of Mapping API, not core)
   </li>
<!-- and probably ObjectCodec too?
 <li>
   </li>
-->
</ul>
