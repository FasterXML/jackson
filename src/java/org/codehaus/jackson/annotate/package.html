This package contains public annotations, most of which are used
to guite Data Binding (usually controlled by
{@link org.codehaus.jackson.map.ObjectMapper}. It also contains
parameter types needed by annotations, mostly enumerations; and
also a dummy marker class {@link NoClass}, which is needed to
work around the problem of 'null' not being valid value for
annotation properties.
