    (reported by Peter L)
  * [JACKSON-372] handle missing primitive type values for @JsonCreator gracefully (with defaults)

  Fixes:

  * [JACKSON-265] Problems with generic wildcard type, type info
   (reported by Fabrice D)
  * [JACKSON-268] Property ordering for JAXB did not work with "raw" property
    names (but just with renamed names like with Jackson annotations)
   (reported by Valentin B)
  * [JACKSON-303] JAXB annotation @XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.NONE) seems
    to not work correctly during deserialisation process
    (reported by David M)

    with just one generic parameter

  Improvements:

  * [JACKSON-193] @JsonCreator-annotated factory methods and @JsonValue annotated
    output methods now work with enums, allowing more customizable enum ser/deser.
    (requested by Paul B)
  * [JACKSON-253] Support combination of @XmlAnyElement + @XmlElementRefs
  * [JACKSON-261] @JsonView now implies that associated element (field,
    getter/setter) is to be considered a property; similar to how
    @JsonSerialize/@JsonDeserialize/@JsonProperty are used.
  * [JACKSON-274] Un-deprecated @JsonGetter and @JsonSetter.
  * [JACKSON-283] JDK atomic types (java.util.concurrent.atomic) supported
  * [JACKSON-289] Added "SerializationConfig.Feature.WRITE_CHAR_ARRAYS_AS_JSON_ARRAYS"
    to allow serializing char[]s as JSON Arrays with single-char-String values
    (also fixed issues with deserializing the same on deserializer side)
    (requested by Brian O)
  * [JACKSON-290] @JsonWriteNullProperties can be used with fields too;
    annotation itself is now deprecated (use JsonSerialize#include instead).

    field
    (requested by Rob O)
  * [JACKSON-302] Add JsonNode.has(String/int) to allow for more convenient checking

    XMLGregorianCalendar now uses same Date/Calendar serialization as other date types.
    (suggested by Igor K)
  * [JACKSON-321] Allow passing JsonNodeFactory to use for ObjectMapper, ObjectReader,
    to allow use of custom JsonNode types.
  * [JACKSON-326] Add 'JsonParser.hasTextCharacters()' to make it easier to optimize
    text access (esp. when copying events)
  * [JACKSON-328] Precedence of "getters-as-setters" (for Maps, Collections) was
    accidentally higher than that of property fields (public, @JsonProperty)
    (reported by Thomas D)
  * [JACKSON-333] Add JsonNode.getValueAsInt()/.getValueAsDouble() for more convenient
     coercion; including parsing of JSON text values to numbers if necessary
  * [JACKSON-339] Support Joda ReadableDateTime, ReadableInstant out of the box
  * [JACKSON-349] Accept empty String as number (null for wrappers, 0 for primitives)

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-41] Add code generation to allow deserialization into arbitrary Bean interfaces.     
  * [JACKSON-210] Add method(s) in JsonNode for finding values of named property
  * [JACKSON-212] Allow serializer/deserializing Enums using toString() method
    instead name()

  * [JACKSON-257] Add ability to register sub-types for Polymetric Type Handling
  * [JACKSON-264] Ability to "update" values; to read and bind JSON
    content as properties of existing beans. This is done by using
    "ObjectMapper.updatingReader()" (and "reader.readValue(source)")
  * [JACKSON-267] Allow unquoted field names to start with '@' in
    (when unquoted name support is enabled, to support polymorphic
    typing (which defaults to property names like "@class").
   (requested by Michel G)
  * [JACKSON-278] Allow access to version information (via new Versioned interface)
   (requested by Andrei V)
  * [JACKSON-282] Added SerializationConfig.Feature.CLOSE_CLOSEABLE
    which when enabled forced a call to value.close() right after
    serialization of a (root-level) value.
  * [JACKSON-287] Add JsonParser.releaseBufferedContent() which can be called
    to "push back" content read but not (yet) consumed by JsonParser
  * [JACKSON-292] Add "any-getter" (using @JsonAnyGetter) to complement @JsonAnySetter,
    more convenient mapping of miscellaneous extra properties.
  * [JACKSON-295] Add 'jackson-all' jar
    (suggested by Ant E)
  * [JACKSON-299] Added 'org.codehaus.jackson.impl.MinimalPrettyPrinter'
    to make it easier to add simple output customizations
    (suggested by David P)
  * [JACKSON-300] Add 'JsonParser.Feature.ALLOW_BACKSLASH_ESCAPING_ANY_CHARACTER
    to allow non-standard character escapes like \'.
    (requested by Ketan G)
  * [JACKSON-314] (go Pi, go!) Add 'SerializationConfig.Feature.WRITE_NULL_MAP_VALUES'
    to suppress writing of Map entries with null values.
  * [JACKSON-316] Allow per-call enable/disable of pretty printing (added
    methods in ObjectWriter; .withPrettyPrinter())
  * [JACKSON-325] Add new Jackson "internal" annotation (@JacksonStdCodec?) to allow
    marking default/standard serializers, deserializers
  * [JACKSON-337] Add "ObjectMapper.valueToTree()"
  
  Backwards incompatible changes

  * [JACKSON-328] (see above) fixes precedence of "getter-as-setter" (for Maps, Collections)
    to be LOWER than that of fields; this is the original intended behavior. However,
    versions 1.1 - 1.5 accidentally had fields at lower precedence. This fix can
    change behavior of code.
  * [JACKSON-308] (see above) Configurable date formatting support for XMLGregorianCalendar:
    since default Date/Calendar formatting uses timestamp instead of textual serialization,
    default XMLGregorianCalendar serialization is changing.

    annotation.
  * [JACKSON-191] Add access to basic statistics on number of cached
    serializers, deserializers (and methods to flush these caches)
  * [JACKSON-192] Added basic delegate implementations (JsonParserDelegate,
    JsonGeneratorDelegate) to make it easier to override core parser and
    generate behavior

  * [JACKSON-180] Added 'JsonParser.Feature.INTERN_FIELD_NAMES' to allow
    disabling field name intern()ing.

    (like Wrapper<Bean>) not just generic Maps and Collections 
  * [JACKSON-121] Problems deserializing Date values of some ISO-8601
    variants (like one using 'Z' to indicate GMT timezone)
  * [JACKSON-122] Annotated serializers and deserializers had to
    be public classes with public default constructor; not any more.

  Improvements:

  * [JACKSON-111] Added "jackson-xc" jar to contains XML Compatibility
    extensions.

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-70] Add support for generating JSON Schema
  * [JACKSON-98] Allow serializing/deserializing field-accessible properties,
    in addition to method-accessible ones.
  * [JACKSON-105] Allow suppressing output of "default values"; which
    means value of a property when bean is constructed using the default
    no-arg constructor
   (requested by Christoph S)
  * [JACKSON-119] Add (optional) support for using JAXB annotations
    (by using JaxbAnnotationIntrospector)
   (requested by Ryan H)
  * [JACKSON-120] Add annotations @JsonSerialize, @JsonDeserialize,
    to streamline annotation by replacing host of existing annotations.
  * [JACKSON-123] Add "chaining" AnnotationIntrospector (implemented
    as inner class, AnnotationIntrospector.Pair) that allows combining
    functionality of 2 introspectors.

1.0.1 [04-Jun-2009]

  Fixes:

  * [JACKSON-104] Build fails on JDK 1.5, assorted other minor issues
   (reported by Oleksander A)
  * [JACKSON-121] Problems deserializing Date values of some ISO-8601
    variants (like one using 'Z' to indicate GMT timezone)

1.0.0 [09-May-2009]

  Fixes:

  * [JACKSON-103] Serializing Groovy objects; need to exclude getter method
    "getMetaClass" from serialization to prevent infinite recursion
   (reported by Ray T)

  Improvements:

  * Removed JAX-RS META-INF/services - based auto-registration for
    JAX-RS MessageBodyReader/MessageBodyWriter, because it could
    conflict with other application/json content handlers.

0.9.9-6 [27-Apr-2009]

  Improvements:

  * Improved jax-rs provider integration with jersey; now properly
    auto-registers as handler for json media type(s), and allows
    for defining custom ObjectMapper to be injected.

0.9.9-5 [20-Apr-2009]

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-88]: Support for "Setter-less" collection (and Map) types

  Improvements:

  * [JACKSON-100]: Allow specifying that BigInteger should be used instead
    of Integer or Long for "generic" integral numeric types (Object, Number)
    (DeserializationConfig.Feature.USE_BIG_INTEGER_FOR_INTS)
  * [JACKSON-101]: Allow disabling of access modifier overrides
    (SerializationgConfig.Feature.CAN_OVERRIDE_ACCESS_MODIFIERS)
    to support more security-constrainted running environments.

0.9.9-4 [14-Apr-2009]

  Fixes:

  * [JACKSON-94] Added missing "JsonParser.readValueAsTree()" method.
  * JacksonJsonProvider was using strict equality comparison against
    JSON type; instead needs to use "isCompatible". There were other
    similar problems
    (reported by Stephen D)
  * [JACKSON-97] Generic types (with bound wildcards) caused problems
    when Class introspector could not figure out that a concrete method
    was overriding/implementing generic method; as well as having
    problems with synthetic bridge methods.

  Improvements:

  * [JACKSON-95] Added support for deserializing simple exceptions
    (Throwable and its sub-classes): anything with a String constructor
    (assumed to take "message") should work to some degree.
  * [JACKSON-99] IOExceptions should not be wrapped during object
    mapping.
    (reported by Eldar A)

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-85]: Make Date deserialization (more) configurable (add
    DeserializationConfig.setDateFormat())
  * [JACKSON-93]: Allow overriding the default ClassIntrospector.
  * [JACKSON-96]: Allow enabling pretty-printing with data binding,
    through SerializationConfig object.

0.9.9-3 [03-Apr-2009]

  Fixes:

  * [JACKSON-79]: Primitive value deserialization fragile wrt nulls
  * [JACKSON-81]: Data binding code could lead to unnecessary blocking
    because it tried to advance parser (and stream) after binding
    (reported by Eldar A)

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-61]: Allow suppressing writing of bean properties with null values
   (requested by Justin F)
  * [JACKSON-63]: Create CustomDeserializerFactory to allow for adding
    custom deserializers for non-structured/generic types.
  * [JACKSON-75]: Add "any setter" method; ability to catch otherwise
    unknown (unmapped) properties and call a method with name+value.
  * [JACKSON-80]: Add @JsonValue annotation, to specify that a Bean value
    is to be serialized as value returned by annotated method: can for
    example annotate "toString()" method.
  * [JACKSON-84]: Added JsonGenerator.writeRawValue methods to augment
    existing JsonGenerator.writeRaw() method
    (requested by Scott A)
  * [JACKSON-86]: Added JsonParser.isClosed() and JsonGenerator.isClosed()
    methods.
  * [JACKSON-87]: Added ability to customized Date/Calendar serialization,
    both by toggling between timestamp (number) and textual (ISO-8601),
    and by specifying alternate DateFormat to use.

0.9.9-2 [19-Mar-2009]:

  Fixes:

  * [JACKSON-75]: Didn't have Deserializer for Number.class.

  Improvements:

  * [JACKSON-68]: Add DeserializationProblemListener, and
    DeserializationConfig.addHandler to add instances to ObjectMapper.
  * [JACKSON-71]: Add support ser/deser of Class.class.
  * [JACKSON-72]: Allow specifying that BigDecimal should be used instead
    of Double for "generic" numeric types (Object, Number)
    (DeserializationConfig.Feature.USE_BIG_DECIMAL_FOR_FLOATS)
  * [JACKSON-73]: Refactored ser/deser configuration settings into
    separate configuration classes.
  * [JACKSON-78]: Should be able to deserialize ints into Booleans (0 == false)

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-45]: Add convenience methods to help writing custom
    serializers
    (requested by Scott A)

0.9.9 [02-Mar-2009]:

  Fixes:

  * [JACKSON-59]: NPE with String[] serializer
    (reported by Kevin G)
  * [JACKSON-62]: NPE with JsonMappingException if source exception used
    null message.
    (reported by Justin F)
  * [JACKSON-64]: Handling of property name (with @JsonGetter, @JsonSetter)
    made bit more intuitive; uses bean naming convention if no explicit
    name given.

  Improvements:

  * [JACKSON-60]: Method annotations did not follow intuitive expectations
    of inheritability; now do.
  * [JACKSON-65]: Need to support typing using "java.lang.reflect.Type", to
    help integration with frameworks.
  * [JACKSON-66]: ObjectMapper now has "canSerialize" and "canDeserialize"
    methods to help frameworks figure out what is supported.

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-52]: Allow disabling name-based auto-detection of
    getter methods
    (requested by Justin F)
  * [JACKSON-58]: Allow defining custom global Enum serializer
    (to, for example, make Enums be serialized using Enum.toString(),
     or lower-case name or such)
  * [JACKSON-67]: Add JAX-RS provider based on Jackson that can handle
    JSON content type; initially as a separate jar.

  Other:

  * [JACKSON-22]: all contributors now have submitted contributor
    agreement, stored under 'DEV/agreements-received' in svn trunk.

0.9.8 [18-Feb-2009]:

  Fixes:

  * [JACKSON-49]: Incorrect bounds check for Float values resulted in
    exception when trying to serializer 0.0f.

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-32]: add annotations to configure serialization process
    (@JsonClass/@JsonContentClass/@JsonKeyClass; @JsonUseSerializer,
     @JsonUseDeserializer, @JsonIgnore)
  * [JACKSON-36]: add annotations to define property names that differ
    from bean naming convention (@JsonGetter/@JsonSetter)

  Improvements:

  * [JACKSON-47]: Change DeserializerProvider.findValueDeserializer to
    take "referrer" information. This is needed to be able to give
    contextual mappings where a given type may be deserialized differently
    (by different deserializer, and possibly to a different java class)
    depending on where the reference is from.
  * [JACKSON-48]: Integrate ObjectMapper with JsonGenerator, JsonParser;
    add MappingJsonFactory.
    (suggested by Scott A)
  * [JACKSON-50]: JsonNode.getElements() and .iterator() now work for
    ObjectNodes too, not just ArrayNodes. Also added convenience factory
    methods to allow constructing child nodes directly from container 
    nodes.
  * [JACKSON-53]: iBatis proxied value classes didn't work; fixed by
    prevent CGLib-generated "getCallbacks" from getting called.
    (reportd by Justin F)
  * [JACKSON-55]: Added support for reference-path-tracking in
    JsonMappingException, made serializers populate it: this to make
    it easier to trouble-shoot nested serialization problems
  * [JACKSON-56]: Added support for RFC-1123 date format, along with
    simpler "standard" format; and can add more as need be.

0.9.7 [04-Feb-2009]:

  Improvements:

  * [JACKSON-34]: Improved packaging by adding an intermediate directory
    in source tarball, to not mess up the current directory (and to indicate
    version number as well)
  * [JACKSON-37]: Make Jackson run on Android, by ensuring that there are
    no hard linkages to classes that Android SDK doesn't have (the only
    reference that was there, to XMLGregorianCalendar, was changed to
    soft linkage)
  * [JACKSON-42]: Add new JsonNode sub-class, BinaryNode, to represent
    base64 encoded binary content.

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-6]: Implement JsonParser.getBinaryValue() so that one can
    now also read Base64-encoded binary, not just write.
  * [JACKSON-40]: Add JsonParser.nextValue() for more convenient
    iteration.
  * [JACKSON-46]: Allow disabling quoting of field names by disabling
    feature 'JsonGenerator.feature.QUOTE_FIELD_NAMES'
   (requested by Scott Anderson)

0.9.6 [14-Jan-2009]:

  Bug fixes:

  * Serialization of some core types (boolean/java.lang.Boolean,
    long/java.lang.Long) was not working due to incorrectly mapped
    serializers.

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-31]: Complete rewrite of ObjectMapper's deserialization:
    now supports Beans, typed (generics-aware) Lists/Maps/arrays.

  Improvements:

  * [JACKSON-24]: Add efficient byte-array - based parser factory
    method to JsonFactory (has maybe 5% improvement over wrapping
    in ByteArrayInputStream).
  * [JACKSON-29]: Split classes in 2 jars: core that has parser and
    generator APIs and implementations; and mapper jar that has object
    and tree mapper code.
  * [JACKSON-30]: Renamed "JavaTypeMapper" as "ObjectMapper", and
    "JsonTypeMapper" as "TreeMapper"; new names should be more intuitive
    to indicate their purpose. Will leave simple implementations of
    old classes to allow for gradual migration of existing code.

0.9.5 [10-Dec-2008]:

  Bug fixes:

  * [JACKSON-25]: Problems with Maven pom for lgpl version
    (report by Ray R)
    note: backported to 0.9.4 Codehaus Maven repo

  Improvements:

  * [JACKSON-13]: JavaTypeMapper can now take JsonFactory argument, and
    thus is able to construct JsonParser/JsonGenerator instances as necessary
  * [JACKSON-17]: Handling of unknown types now configurable with
    JavaTypeMapper serialization (see JsonSerializerProvider for methods)
  * [JACKSON-20]: Handling of nulls (key, value) configurable with
    JavaTypeMapper serialization (see JsonSerializerProvider for methods)
  * [JACKSON-26]: Add convenience JsonGenerator.writeXxxField() methods
    to simplify json generation.

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-27]: Allow automatic closing of incomplete START_ARRAY and
    START_OBJECT events, when JsonGenerator.close() is called.

0.9.4 [26-Nov-2008]:

  Bug fixes:

  * [JACKSON-16]: JavaDocs regarding whether Jackson is to close underlying
    streams, readers and writers, were incorrect. Additionally added
    parser/generator features to allow specifying whether automatic closing
    is to be done by Jackson: feature is enabled by default, both for
    backwards compatibility, and because it seems like the right setting.
  * [JACKSON-18]: ArrayIndexOutOfBounds on IntNode, due to off-by-one
    problem with comparisons
   (reported by Michael D)
  * Fixed a problem with CR (\r) handling; was sometimes skipping
    characters (problematic if there's no indentation).
  * Multiple UTF-8 decoding fixes: was specifically not working for
    names.

  Improvements:

  * More complete JavaDoc comments for core public classes.
  * Internal cleanup of core parsing, to unify handling of Object and
    Array entries

0.8.0 - 0.9.3 [between 17-Oct-2007 and 05-Sep-2008]:

  Changes:

  * [JACKSON-5]: Symbol table construction was not thread-safe for
    utf-8 encoded content (new bug with 0.9.2, not present with earlier)
   (reported by Tudor B)
  * [JACKSON-8]: Serialization of BigDecimal broken with JavaTypeMapper
   (reported by Johannes L)
  * [JACKSON-9]: Add support for (non-standard) Json comments.
    (requested by Mike G)
  * [JACKSON-11]: Implement base64/binary methods for json generator.
  * [JACKSON-14]: Problems with generic collections, serializer
    method signatures (due to lack of covariance wrt collection types)
  * [JACKSON-15]: Add copy-through methods to JsonGenerator for
    pass-through copying of content (copyCurrentEvent, copyCurrentStructure)
  * [JACKSON-23]: Add OSGi manifest headers for jars (to run on OSGi container).
  * Added generic "feature" mechanism to parsers, writers; features are
    togglable (on/off) things with well-defined default values, implemented
    as Enums.

  * [JACKSON-1]: JsonNode now implements Iterable<JsonNode> so that
    it is possible use Java 5 foreach loop over array/object nodes.
   (suggested by Michael M)
  * [JACKSON-4] Added JsonParser.skipChildren() method.
  * UTF-16/32 handling was not completely correct, was erroneously
    skipping first 2/4 bytes in some cases (even when no BOM included).
    Also, related unit tests added/fixed.
  * JsonGenerator.useDefaultPrettyPrinter()/.setPrettyPrinter()
    allow for pretty printing (indentation).
   (thanks to Ziad M for suggestion, sample code)

  * Implicit conversions for numbers could sometimes lose accuracy,
    if floating-point number was first accessed as int/long, and then
    as a BigDecimal.
  * One Nasty NPE fixed from NameCanonicalizer (which was added in 0.9.2)

  * Java type mapper had a bug in Collection mapping (mismatched
    calls between writeStartArray and writeEndObject!)
   (reported by Mike E)
  * Java type mapper had a bug which prevented custom mappers (as
    well as slower interface-based introspection) from working.
   (reported by Mike E)
  * Numeric value parsing had some problems
  * JavaTypeMapper and JsonTypeMapper had a bug which resulted
    in NullPointerException when stream ends, instead of returning
    null to indicate it.
   (reported by Augusto C)
  * JavaTypeMapper did not implicitly flush generator after mapping
    objects: it should, and now will (note: JsonTypeMapper not directly
    affected, flushing still needed)
   (suggested by Maciej P)
