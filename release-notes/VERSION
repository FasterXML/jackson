Version: 0.9.9-4

Release date:
  xx-Apr-2009

Description:
  Another pre-1.0 release.

  Fixes:

  * [JACKSON-94] Added missing "JsonParser.readValueAsTree()" method.
  * JacksonJsonProvider was using strict equality comparison against
    JSON type; instead needs to use "isCompatible". There were other
    similar problems
    (reported by Stephen D)
  * [JACKSON-97] Generic types (with bound wildcards) caused problems
    when Class introspector could not figure out that a concrete method
    was overriding/implementing generic method; as well as having
    problems with synthetic bridge methods.

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-85]: Make Date deserialization (more) configurable (add
    DeserializationConfig.setDateFormat())
  * [JACKSON-96]: Allow enabling pretty-printing with data binding,
    through SerializationConfig object.

0.9.9-3 [03-Apr-2009]

  Fixes:

  * [JACKSON-79]: Primitive value deserialization fragile wrt nulls
  * [JACKSON-81]: Data binding code could lead to unnecessary blocking
    because it tried to advance parser (and stream) after binding
    (reported by Eldar A)

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-61]: Allow suppressing writing of bean properties with null values
   (requested by Justin F)
  * [JACKSON-63]: Create CustomDeserializerFactory to allow for adding
    custom deserializers for non-structured/generic types.
  * [JACKSON-75]: Add "any setter" method; ability to catch otherwise
    unknown (unmapped) properties and call a method with name+value.
  * [JACKSON-80]: Add @JsonValue annotation, to specify that a Bean value
    is to be serialized as value returned by annotated method: can for
    example annotate "toString()" method.
  * [JACKSON-84]: Added JsonGenerator.writeRawValue methods to augment
    existing JsonGenerator.writeRaw() method
    (requested by Scott A)
  * [JACKSON-86]: Added JsonParser.isClosed() and JsonGenerator.isClosed()
    methods.
  * [JACKSON-87]: Added ability to customized Date/Calendar serialization,
    both by toggling between timestamp (number) and textual (ISO-8601),
    and by specifying alternate DateFormat to use.

0.9.9-2 [19-Mar-2009]:

  Fixes:

  * [JACKSON-75]: Didn't have Deserializer for Number.class.

  Improvements:

  * [JACKSON-68]: Add DeserializationProblemListener, and
    DeserializationConfig.addHandler to add instances to ObjectMapper.
  * [JACKSON-71]: Add support ser/deser of Class.class.
  * [JACKSON-72]: Allow specifying that BigDecimal should be used instead
    of Double for "generic" numeric types (Object, Number)
  * [JACKSON-73]: Refactored ser/deser configuration settings into
    separate configuration classes.
  * [JACKSON-78]: Should be able to deserialize ints into Booleans (0 == false)

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-45]: Add convenience methods to help writing custom
    serializers
    (requested by Scott A)

0.9.9 [02-Mar-2009]:

  Fixes:

  * [JACKSON-59]: NPE with String[] serializer
    (reported by Kevin G)
  * [JACKSON-62]: NPE with JsonMappingException if source exception used
    null message.
    (reported by Justin F)
  * [JACKSON-64]: Handling of property name (with @JsonGetter, @JsonSetter)
    made bit more intuitive; uses bean naming convention if no explicit
    name given.

  Improvements:

  * [JACKSON-60]: Method annotations did not follow intuitive expectations
    of inheritability; now do.
  * [JACKSON-65]: Need to support typing using "java.lang.reflect.Type", to
    help integration with frameworks.
  * [JACKSON-66]: ObjectMapper now has "canSerialize" and "canDeserialize"
    methods to help frameworks figure out what is supported.

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-52]: Allow disabling name-based auto-detection of
    getter methods
    (requested by Justin F)
  * [JACKSON-58]: Allow defining custom global Enum serializer
    (to, for example, make Enums be serialized using Enum.toString(),
     or lower-case name or such)
  * [JACKSON-67]: Add JAX-RS provider based on Jackson that can handle
    JSON content type; initially as a separate jar.

  Other:

  * [JACKSON-22]: all contributors now have submitted contributor
    agreement, stored under 'DEV/agreements-received' in svn trunk.

0.9.8 [18-Feb-2009]:

  Fixes:

  * [JACKSON-49]: Incorrect bounds check for Float values resulted in
    exception when trying to serializer 0.0f.

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-32]: add annotations to configure serialization process
    (@JsonClass/@JsonContentClass/@JsonKeyClass; @JsonUseSerializer,
     @JsonUseDeserializer, @JsonIgnore)
  * [JACKSON-36]: add annotations to define property names that differ
    from bean naming convention (@JsonGetter/@JsonSetter)

  Improvements:

  * [JACKSON-47]: Change DeserializerProvider.findValueDeserializer to
    take "referrer" information. This is needed to be able to give
    contextual mappings where a given type may be deserialized differently
    (by different deserializer, and possibly to a different java class)
    depending on where the reference is from.
  * [JACKSON-48]: Integrate ObjectMapper with JsonGenerator, JsonParser;
    add MappingJsonFactory.
    (suggested by Scott A)
  * [JACKSON-50]: JsonNode.getElements() and .iterator() now work for
    ObjectNodes too, not just ArrayNodes. Also added convenience factory
    methods to allow constructing child nodes directly from container 
    nodes.
  * [JACKSON-53]: iBatis proxied value classes didn't work; fixed by
    prevent CGLib-generated "getCallbacks" from getting called.
    (reportd by Justin F)
  * [JACKSON-55]: Added support for reference-path-tracking in
    JsonMappingException, made serializers populate it: this to make
    it easier to trouble-shoot nested serialization problems
  * [JACKSON-56]: Added support for RFC-1123 date format, along with
    simpler "standard" format; and can add more as need be.

0.9.7 [04-Feb-2009]:

  Improvements:

  * [JACKSON-34]: Improved packaging by adding an intermediate directory
    in source tarball, to not mess up the current directory (and to indicate
    version number as well)
  * [JACKSON-37]: Make Jackson run on Android, by ensuring that there are
    no hard linkages to classes that Android SDK doesn't have (the only
    reference that was there, to XMLGregorianCalendar, was changed to
    soft linkage)
  * [JACKSON-42]: Add new JsonNode sub-class, BinaryNode, to represent
    base64 encoded binary content.

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-6]: Implement JsonParser.getBinaryValue() so that one can
    now also read Base64-encoded binary, not just write.
  * [JACKSON-40]: Add JsonParser.nextValue() for more convenient
    iteration.
  * [JACKSON-46]: Allow disabling quoting of field names by disabling
    feature 'JsonGenerator.feature.QUOTE_FIELD_NAMES'
   (requested by Scott Anderson)

0.9.6 [14-Jan-2009]:

  Bug fixes:

  * Serialization of some core types (boolean/java.lang.Boolean,
    long/java.lang.Long) was not working due to incorrectly mapped
    serializers.

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-31]: Complete rewrite of ObjectMapper's deserialization:
    now supports Beans, typed (generics-aware) Lists/Maps/arrays.

  Improvements:

  * [JACKSON-24]: Add efficient byte-array - based parser factory
    method to JsonFactory (has maybe 5% improvement over wrapping
    in ByteArrayInputStream).
  * [JACKSON-29]: Split classes in 2 jars: core that has parser and
    generator APIs and implementations; and mapper jar that has object
    and tree mapper code.
  * [JACKSON-30]: Renamed "JavaTypeMapper" as "ObjectMapper", and
    "JsonTypeMapper" as "TreeMapper"; new names should be more intuitive
    to indicate their purpose. Will leave simple implementations of
    old classes to allow for gradual migration of existing code.

0.9.5 [10-Dec-2008]:

  Bug fixes:

  * [JACKSON-25]: Problems with Maven pom for lgpl version
    (report by Ray R)
    note: backported to 0.9.4 Codehaus Maven repo

  Improvements:

  * [JACKSON-13]: JavaTypeMapper can now take JsonFactory argument, and
    thus is able to construct JsonParser/JsonGenerator instances as necessary
  * [JACKSON-17]: Handling of unknown types now configurable with
    JavaTypeMapper serialization (see JsonSerializerProvider for methods)
  * [JACKSON-20]: Handling of nulls (key, value) configurable with
    JavaTypeMapper serialization (see JsonSerializerProvider for methods)
  * [JACKSON-26]: Add convenience JsonGenerator.writeXxxField() methods
    to simplify json generation.

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-27]: Allow automatic closing of incomplete START_ARRAY and
    START_OBJECT events, when JsonGenerator.close() is called.

0.9.4 [26-Nov-2008]:

  Bug fixes:

  * [JACKSON-16]: JavaDocs regarding whether Jackson is to close underlying
    streams, readers and writers, were incorrect. Additionally added
    parser/generator features to allow specifying whether automatic closing
    is to be done by Jackson: feature is enabled by default, both for
    backwards compatibility, and because it seems like the right setting.
  * [JACKSON-18]: ArrayIndexOutOfBounds on IntNode, due to off-by-one
    problem with comparisons
   (reported by Michael D)
  * Fixed a problem with CR (\r) handling; was sometimes skipping
    characters (problematic if there's no indentation).
  * Multiple UTF-8 decoding fixes: was specifically not working for
    names.

  Improvements:

  * More complete JavaDoc comments for core public classes.
  * Internal cleanup of core parsing, to unify handling of Object and
    Array entries

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-9]: Add support for (non-standard) Json comments.
    (requested by Mike G)
  * [JACKSON-11]: Implement base64/binary methods for json generator.
  * [JACKSON-15]: Add copy-through methods to JsonGenerator for
    pass-through copying of content (copyCurrentEvent, copyCurrentStructure)
  * [JACKSON-23]: Add OSGi manifest headers for jars (to run on OSGi container).
  * Added generic "feature" mechanism to parsers, writers; features are
    togglable (on/off) things with well-defined default values, implemented
    as Enums.

0.9.3 [05-Sep-2008]:

  Bug fixes:

  * [JACKSON-5]: Symbol table construction was not thread-safe for
    utf-8 encoded content (new bug with 0.9.2, not present with earlier)
   (reported by Tudor B)
  * [JACKSON-8]: Serialization of BigDecimal broken with JavaTypeMapper
   (reported by Johannes L)
  * [JACKSON-14]: Problems with generic collections, serializer
    method signatures (due to lack of covariance wrt collection types)
  * Implicit conversions for numbers could sometimes lose accuracy,
    if floating-point number was first accessed as int/long, and then
    as a BigDecimal.
  * One Nasty NPE fixed from NameCanonicalizer (which was added in 0.9.2)

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-1]: JsonNode now implements Iterable<JsonNode> so that
    it is possible use Java 5 foreach loop over array/object nodes.
   (suggested by Michael M)
  * [JACKSON-4] Added JsonParser.skipChildren() method.

0.9.2 [24-Apr-2008]:

  Bug fixes:

  * UTF-16/32 handling was not completely correct, was erroneously
    skipping first 2/4 bytes in some cases (even when no BOM included).
    Also, related unit tests added/fixed.

  Changes:

  * Replace JsonFactory.Encoding enum with JsonEncoding enum
    (NOTE: this is a backwards-incompatible API change)

  Improvements:

  * New higher performing UTF-8 scanner.

0.9.1 [14-Mar-2008]:

  New features:

  * JsonGenerator.useDefaultPrettyPrinter()/.setPrettyPrinter()
    allow for pretty printing (indentation).
   (thanks to Ziad M for suggestion, sample code)

0.8.0 - 0.9.0 [between 17-Oct-2007 and 14-Feb-2008]:

  Bug fixes:

  * Java type mapper had a bug in Collection mapping (mismatched
    calls between writeStartArray and writeEndObject!)
   (reported by Mike E)
  * Java type mapper had a bug which prevented custom mappers (as
    well as slower interface-based introspection) from working.
   (reported by Mike E)
  * Numeric value parsing had some problems
  * JavaTypeMapper and JsonTypeMapper had a bug which resulted
    in NullPointerException when stream ends, instead of returning
    null to indicate it.
   (reported by Augusto C)
  * JavaTypeMapper did not implicitly flush generator after mapping
    objects: it should, and now will (note: JsonTypeMapper not directly
    affected, flushing still needed)
   (suggested by Maciej P)
