Version: 0.9.4

Release date: 
  26-Nov-2008

Description:
  Another pre-1.0 release: this time significantly improving unit test
  coverage, fixing bugs uncovered by doing so, and addressing accumulated
  minor feature requests.

  Bug fixes:

  * [JACKSON-16]: JavaDocs regarding whether Jackson is to close underlying
    streams, readers and writers, were incorrect. Additionally added
    parser/generator features to allow specifying whether automatic closing
    is to be done by Jackson: feature is enabled by default, both for
    backwards compatibility, and because it seems like the right setting.
  * [JACKSON-18]: ArrayIndexOutOfBounds on IntNode, due to off-by-one
    problem with comparisons
   (reported by Michael D)
  * Fixed a problem with CR (\r) handling; was sometimes skipping
    characters (problematic if there's no indentation).
  * Multiple UTF-8 decoding fixes: was specifically not working for
    names.

  Improvements:

  * More complete JavaDoc comments for core public classes.
  * Internal cleanup of core parsing, to unify handling of Object and
    Array entries

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-9]: Add support for (non-standard) Json comments.
    (requested by Mike G)
  * [JACKSON-11]: Implement base64/binary methods for json generator.
  * [JACKSON-15]: Add copy-through methods to JsonGenerator for
    pass-through copying of content (copyCurrentEvent, copyCurrentStructure)
  * [JACKSON-23]: Add OSGi manifest headers for jars (to run on OSGi container).
  * Added generic "feature" mechanism to parsers, writers; features are
    togglable (on/off) things with well-defined default values, implemented
    as Enums.

== History: ==

0.9.3 [05-Sep-2008]:

  Bug fixes:

  * [JACKSON-5]: Symbol table construction was not thread-safe for
    utf-8 encoded content (new bug with 0.9.2, not present with earlier)
   (reported by Tudor B)
  * [JACKSON-8]: Serialization of BigDecimal broken with JavaTypeMapper
   (reported by Johannes L)
  * [JACKSON-14]: Problems with generic collections, serializer
    method signatures (due to lack of covariance wrt collection types)
  * Implicit conversions for numbers could sometimes lose accuracy,
    if floating-point number was first accessed as int/long, and then
    as a BigDecimal.
  * One Nasty NPE fixed from NameCanonicalizer (which was added in 0.9.2)

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-1]: JsonNode now implements Iterable<JsonNode> so that
    it is possible use Java 5 foreach loop over array/object nodes.
   (suggested by Michael M)
  * [JACKSON-4] Added JsonParser.skipChildren() method.

0.9.2 [24-Apr-2008]:

  Bug fixes:

  * UTF-16/32 handling was not completely correct, was erroneously
    skipping first 2/4 bytes in some cases (even when no BOM included).
    Also, related unit tests added/fixed.

  Changes:

  * Replace JsonFactory.Encoding enum with JsonEncoding enum
    (NOTE: this is a backwards-incompatible API change)

  Improvements:

  * New higher performing UTF-8 scanner.

0.9.1 [14-Mar-2008]:

  New features:

  * JsonGenerator.useDefaultPrettyPrinter()/.setPrettyPrinter()
    allow for pretty printing (indentation).
   (thanks to Ziad M for suggestion, sample code)

0.8.0 - 0.9.0 [between 17-Oct-2007 and 14-Feb-2008]:

  Bug fixes:

  * Java type mapper had a bug in Collection mapping (mismatched
    calls between writeStartArray and writeEndObject!)
   (reported by Mike E)
  * Java type mapper had a bug which prevented custom mappers (as
    well as slower interface-based introspection) from working.
   (reported by Mike E)
  * Numeric value parsing had some problems
  * JavaTypeMapper and JsonTypeMapper had a bug which resulted
    in NullPointerException when stream ends, instead of returning
    null to indicate it.
   (reported by Augusto C)
  * JavaTypeMapper did not implicitly flush generator after mapping
    objects: it should, and now will (note: JsonTypeMapper not directly
    affected, flushing still needed)
   (suggested by Maciej P)
